        <p>Railroader is a security static analysis tool for
applications written using Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Railroader will examine your program to look for potential
problems, and warn you about them.
Railroader can&rsquo;t find every vulnerability, but it&rsquo;s a great tool to help
you find problems <em>before</em> they hurt anyone.
It is a <em>static</em> analysis tool - that means it does not try to run
the application you are analyzing.</p>

<p>Railroader is open source software (OSS) released under the MIT license.
You can use it for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and
<a href="/contributions">we love contributions</a>.</p>

<p>Railroader is a fork of the Brakeman tool, which was once OSS but is no longer. If you want Brakeman, go to the
<a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman website</a> instead.
Railroader is not Brakeman, though they share a common history.
If you find something in our documentation that incorrectly
implies that Railroader is Brakeman, please let us know so we can fix it.</p>

<p>The name Railroader was chosen because a railroader is someone
who employed to operate or manage a railroad.
Basically, we want to help you safely get where you are going on Rails.
We thought it&rsquo;d be good to play on the theme of Rails since it support Rails.
The name is also in the long tradition of a later name being a riff on
the older name (such as bison from yacc, or flex from lex).
We also want to make sure the name is completely different
from Brakeman (and it is).</p>

<p>Railroader is easy to <a href="/install">install</a> and <a href="/use">use</a>.
So please do so!</p>
