      <description>Welcome to Railroader!
Railroader is a security static analysis tool for analyzing applications that use Ruby on Rails. It is open source software (OSS) using the MIT license.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to install and use.
Railroader is a fork of the Brakeman tool, which was once OSS but is no longer. If you want Brakeman, go to the Brakeman website instead.</description>

      <description>Railroader is a security static analysis tool for applications written using Ruby on Rails.
Railroader will examine your program to look for potential problems, and warn you about them. Railroader can&amp;rsquo;t find every vulnerability, but it&amp;rsquo;s a great tool to help you find problems before they hurt anyone. It is a static analysis tool - that means it does not try to run the application you are analyzing.
Railroader is open source software (OSS) released under the MIT license.</description>

      <description>Railroader is easy to use if you have any familiarity with Ruby on Rails.
In your Ruby on Rails application, just modify its Gemfile to include railroader, like this:
group :development, :test do gem &#39;railroader&#39; end  Then install it the usual way using bundle:
bundle install  That&amp;rsquo;s it! You are ready to use Railroader.</description>

      <description>Once you have installed Railroader, you can then analyze your software any time.
Using the command line, make sure your current directory is at the top of your application. Then just run railroader, like this:
railroader  It will analyze the software and report any warnings.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s easy to run, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to integrate into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline. Railroader returns failure (nonzero) if there&amp;rsquo;s a problem, so just add it to the set of commands that should normally succeed.</description>

      <description>This warning comes up if a model does not limit what attributes can be set through mass assignment.
In particular, this check looks for attr_accessible inside model definitions. If it is not found, this warning will be issued.
Railroader also warns on use of attr_protected - especially since it was found to be vulnerable to bypass. Warnings for mass assignment on models using attr_protected will be reported, but at a lower confidence level.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Authentication&amp;rdquo; is the act of verifying that a user or client is who they say they are.
Right now, the only Railroader warning in the authentication category is regarding hardcoded passwords. Railroader will warn about constants with literal string values that appear to be passwords.
Hardcoded passwords are security issues since they imply a single password and that password is stored in the source code. Typically source code is available to a wide number of people inside an organization, and there have been many instances of source code leaking to the public.</description>

      <description>When skipping before_filters with security implications, a &amp;ldquo;whitelist&amp;rdquo; approach using only should be used instead of except. This ensures actions are protected by default, and unprotected only by exception.

      <description>In Rails 3.1, a new feature was added to simplify basic authentication.
The example provided in the official Rails Guide looks like this:
class PostsController &amp;lt; ApplicationController http_basic_authenticate_with :name =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;dhh&amp;quot;, :password =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot;, :except =&amp;gt; :index #... end  This warning will be raised if http_basic_authenticate_with is used and the password is found to be a string (i.e., stored somewhere in the code).

      <guid>https://railroader.org/docs/warning_types/command_injection/</guid>
      <description>Injection is #1 on the 2010 OWASP Top Ten web security risks. Command injection occurs when shell commands unsafely include user-manipulatable values.
There are many ways to run commands in Ruby:
`ls #{params[:file]}` system(&amp;quot;ls #{params[:dir]}&amp;quot;) exec(&amp;quot;md5sum #{params[:input]}&amp;quot;)  Railroader will warn on any method like these that uses user input or unsafely interpolates variables.
See the Ruby Security Guide for details.

      <guid>https://railroader.org/docs/confidence/</guid>
      <description>Railroader assigns each warning a confidence level. This rating is intended to indicate how certain Railroader is that the given warning is a real problem.
The following guidelines are used:
 High - Either this is a simple warning or user input is very likely being used in unsafe ways. Medium - This generally indicates an unsafe use of a variable, but the variable may or may not be user input.</description>

      <description>The simplest way to contribute to the improvement of Railroader is to run it against your own applications and then report any issues here.
Suggestions are welcome, too!
See contributing for the basics on contributing.
Testing on Different Platforms Railroader should work on most platforms without a problem. It is typically tested against MRI 1.8.7 and 1.9.3, so any problems outside those two should definitely be reported.

      <guid>https://railroader.org/docs/warning_types/cross-site_request_forgery/</guid>
      <description>Cross-site request forgery is #5 on the OWASP Top Ten. CSRF allows an attacker to perform actions on a website as if they are an authenticated user.
This warning is raised when no call to protect_from_forgery is found in ApplicationController. This method prevents CSRF.
For Rails 4 applications, it is recommended that you use protect_from_forgery :with =&amp;gt; :exception. This code is inserted into newly generated applications. The default is to nil out the session object, which has been a source of many CSRF bypasses due to session memoization.</description>

      <description>Cross site scripting (or XSS) is #2 on the 2010 OWASP Top Ten web security risks and it pops up nearly everywhere.
XSS occurs when a user-manipulatable value is displayed on a web page without escaping it, allowing someone to inject Javascript or HTML into the page.
In Rails 2.x, values need to be explicitly escaped (e.g., by using the h method). In Rails 3.x, auto-escaping in views is enabled by default.</description>

content_tag is a view helper which generates an HTML tag with some content:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; content_tag :p, &amp;quot;Hi!&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;quot;  In Rails 2, this content is unescaped (although attribute values are escaped):</description>

XSS occurs when a user-manipulatable value is displayed on a web page without escaping it, allowing someone to inject Javascript or HTML into the page. Calls to Hash#to_json can be used to trigger XSS.

      <description>In the 2.x versions of Rails, link_to would not escape the body of the HREF.
For example, this will popup an alert box:
link_to &amp;quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(1)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;http://google.com&amp;quot;  Railroader warns on cases where the first parameter contains user input.

      <description>Even though Rails will escape the link provided to link_to, values starting with &amp;ldquo;javascript:&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;data:&amp;rdquo; are unescaped and dangerous.
Railroader will warn on if user values are used to provide the HREF value in link_to or if they are interpolated at the beginning of a string.
The --url-safe-methods option can be used to specify methods which make URLs safe.

#Rails 2.x map.connect &amp;quot;:controller/:action/:id&amp;quot;  or
Rails 3.x match &#39;:controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))&#39;  in config/routes.rb. This allows any public method on any controller to be called as an action.
If this warning is reported for a particular controller, it means there is a route to that controller containing :action.
Default routes can be dangerous if methods are made public which are not intended to be used as URLs or actions.</description>

      <description>Denial of Service (DoS) is any attack which causes a service to become unavailable for legitimate clients.
For issues that Railroader detects, this typically arises in the form of memory leaks. In particular, since Symbols are not garbage collected, creation of large numbers of Symbols could lead to a server running out of memory.
Railroader checks for instances of user input which is converted to a Symbol. When this is not restricted, an attacker could create an unlimited number of Symbols.</description>

      <guid>https://railroader.org/docs/warning_types/dynamic_render_paths/</guid>
      <description>When a call to render uses a dynamically generated path, template name, file name, or action, there is the possibility that a user can access templates that should be restricted. The issue may be worse if those templates execute code or modify the database.
This warning is shown whenever the path to be rendered is not a static string or symbol.
These warnings are often false positives, however, because it can be difficult to manipulate Rails&amp;rsquo; assumptions about paths to perform malicious behavior.</description>

Using ^ and $ is not sufficient, as they will only match up to a new line. This allows an attacker to put whatever malicious input they would like before or after a new line character.

      <description>Railroader hangs while processing my app. What do I do? Sorry about that! Please follow these instructions.
Railroader is reporting parsing errors, but my app runs fine. What&amp;rsquo;s going on? Railroader relies on ruby_parser for parsing Ruby code. Support for Ruby 1.9 syntax is still in development, so Railroader cannot handle all the new 1.9 syntax changes. Unfortunately, the next version of ruby_parser (3.0) makes some large, incompatible changes which will also require major changes in Railroader.</description>

      <description>False positives (warnings about potential vulnerabilities which are not actual vulnerabilities) are present in any security tool. Before ignoring a false positive, be certain it is actually a false positive and also consider reporting it in case changes can be made to Railroader to prevent the false positive in the future.
The ignore configuration is a JSON file containing a list of warnings. This is essentially the same as the JSON report, except the warnings can also have a note field.</description>

      <description>Also known as information leakage or information exposure, this vulnerability refers to system or internal information (such as debugging output, stack traces, error messages, etc.) which is displayed to an end user.
For example, Rails provides detailed exception reports by default in the development environment, but it is turned off by default in production:
# Full error reports are disabled config.consider_all_requests_local = false  Railroader warns if this setting is true in production or there is a show_detailed_exceptions?</description>

      <description>Railroader is a security scanner for Ruby on Rails applications.
Unlike many web security scanners, Railroader looks at the source code of your application. This means you do not need to set up your whole application stack to use it.
Once Railroader scans the application code, it produces a report of all security issues it has found.
Advantages No Configuration Necessary Railroader requires zero setup or configuration once it is installed.</description>

      <description>The main goal when setting up a job is to have Jenkins run Railroader, and then the plugin will read the results.
Ruby must be installed on the Jenkins server.
Enable the plugin On the job configuration page, check the box next to &amp;ldquo;Publish Railroader warnings&amp;rdquo;. On newer builds of Jenkins, you&amp;rsquo;ll find this under the &amp;ldquo;Add post-build action&amp;rdquo; dropdown at the bottom of the page.
The plugin will look for an output file from Railroader in the work directory.</description>

User.new(params[:user])  Unfortunately, if there is a user field called admin which controls administrator access, now any user can make themselves an administrator with a query like
?user[admin]=true  Rails With Strong Parameters In Rails 4 and newer, protection for mass assignment is on by default.
Query parameters must be explicitly whitelisted via permit in order to be used in mass assignment:</description>

      <description>Railroader was initially designed to be used a command-line application. Recently, there have been some changes to allow it to be used as a library as well. Future releases will likely make it even easier to use.
Simple Example Here is a simple example:
require &#39;railroader&#39; tracker = Railroader.run &amp;quot;my/app&amp;quot; puts tracker.report  This runs Railroader against the Rails application in my/app and prints out the report. This is essentially equivalent to running Railroader with no options.</description>

Railroader can generate and install a basic Rake task for a Rails application.
To do so, just run this at the root directory of the Rails application:
railroader --rake  This will create a task in lib/tasks/railroader.rake that looks like this:
namespace :railroader do desc &amp;quot;Run Railroader&amp;quot; task :run, :output_files do |t, args| require &#39;railroader&#39; files = args[:output_files].</description>

      <description>Unvalidated redirects and forwards are #10 on the OWASP Top Ten.
Redirects which rely on user-supplied values can be used to &amp;ldquo;spoof&amp;rdquo; websites or hide malicious links in otherwise harmless-looking URLs. They can also allow access to restricted areas of a site if the destination is not validated.
Railroader will raise warnings whenever redirect_to appears to be used with a user-supplied value that may allow them to change the :host option.</description>

      <description>By default, Railroader reports as much as possible. Because there is no way for Railroader to know if certain items are actually safe or not, it errs on the side of reporting too much rather than possibly not reporting a real problem. Sometimes, though, these false positives can become overwhelming. Railroader does provides many options for customizing reports. It is also possible to ignore specific warnings.
It is recommended to always run Railroader with the default settings first (and then periodically after that), but it is possible to narrow down the results to make them less annoying.</description>

      <description>Railroader reports on several cases of remote code execution, in which a user is able to control and execute code in ways unintended by application authors.
The obvious form of this is the use of eval with user input.
However, Railroader also reports on dangerous uses of send, constantize, and other methods which allow creation of arbitrary objects or calling of arbitrary methods.

      <description>As seen in CVE-2013-0156, calling YAML.load with user input can lead to remote execution of arbitrary code. (To see a real point-and-fire exploit, see the Metasploit payload). While upgrading Rails, disabling XML parsing, or disabling YAML types in XML request parsing will fix the Rails vulnerability, manually passing user input to YAML.load remains unsafe.

      <guid>https://railroader.org/docs/warning_types/cve-2011-3186/</guid>
      <description>Response splitting is a simple attack that can be used as part or a larger exploit chain. A malicious user sends data that causes the HTTP response header to include unintended newline characters which are interpreted as the end of the header. The attacker may then forge their own response body and an entirely false HTTP response, essentailly hijacking the entire page load.
Versions of Rails 2 previous to 2.3.13 were vulnerable to this type of attack.</description>

      <description>The simplest way to get started with Railroader is to just run it with no options in the root directory of your Rails application:
cd your_rails_app/ railroader  This will scan the application in the current directory and output a report to the command line.
Alternatively, you can supply a path as an option to Railroader:
railroader your_rails_app  Even more specifically:
railroader -p your_rails_app  Railroader Options

Railroader focuses on ActiveRecord methods dealing with building SQL statements.
A basic (Rails 2.x) example looks like this:
User.first(:conditions =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;username = &#39;#{params[:username]}&#39;&amp;quot;)  Railroader would produce a warning like this:</description>

      <description>Simply using SSL isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to ensure the data you are sending is secure. Man in the middle (MITM) attacks are well known and widely used. In some cases, these attacks rely on the client to establish a connection that doesn&amp;rsquo;t check the validity of the SSL certificate presented by the server. In this case, the attacker can present their own certificate and act as a man in the middle.</description>

      <description>Session manipulation can occur when an application allows user-input in session keys. Since sessions are typically considered a source of truth (e.g. to check the logged-in user or to match CSRF tokens), allowing an attacker to manipulate the session may lead to unintended behavior.
For example:
user_id = session[params[:name]] current_user = User.find(user_id)  In this scenario, the attacker can point the name parameter to some other session value (for example, _csrf_token) that will be interpreted as a user ID.</description>

Instead, it should be scoped to the currently logged-in user:</description>
