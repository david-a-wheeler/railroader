<p>By default, Railroader reports as much as possible. Because there is no way for Railroader to know if certain items are actually safe or not, it errs on the side of reporting <em>too much</em> rather than possibly not reporting a real problem. Sometimes, though, these false positives can become overwhelming. Railroader does provides many options for customizing reports. It is also possible <a href="/docs/ignoring_false_positives">to ignore specific warnings</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended to always run Railroader with the default settings first (and then periodically after that), but it is possible to narrow down the results to make them less annoying.</p>

<h3 id="specify-checks-to-run">Specify Checks to Run</h3>

<p>When running Railroader, one can specify a set of checks to run or a set to exclude using the <code>--test</code> or <code>--except</code>, respectively. These options take a comma-separated list of check names, which are case-sensitive. Use <code>railroader --checks</code> to get a list of the exact check names.</p>

<p>For example, to only check for SQL injection and cross-site scripting:</p>

<pre><code>railroader --test CheckSQL,CheckCrossSiteScripting
</code></pre>

<p><em>(&lsquo;Check&rsquo; can actually be omitted from the names.)</em></p>

<p>To exclude checks for dynamic render paths:</p>

<pre><code>railroader --except CheckRender
</code></pre>

<h3 id="set-confidence-threshold">Set Confidence Threshold</h3>

<p>Getting a ton of weak confidence warnings? Use <code>-w3</code> to only report high confidence warnings or <code>-w2</code> to only report high and medium confidence warnings.</p>

<p>(Use of <code>-w3</code> is not recommended, however.)</p>

<h3 id="mark-methods-as-safe">Mark Methods as Safe</h3>

<p>If an applications has custome sanitizing methods or just methods which are known to be safe, then the <code>--safe-methods</code> option can be used to ignore those methods. Specify the methods as a comma-separated list.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>railroader --safe-methods this_one,that_one,totally_safe,my_sanitizer
</code></pre>

<h3 id="only-reporting-direct-vulnerabilities">Only Reporting Direct Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>With the default settings, Railroader will report cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if the return value of a method where user input is a <em>parameter</em> is output.</p>

<p>For example, this will raise a warning unless <code>some_method</code> is marked as safe like above:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= some_method(params[:blah]) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To ignore this kind of output, use the <code>--report-direct</code> option. This also applies to some other situations, such as checking calls to <code>redirect_to</code>.</p>

<h3 id="ignoring-model-attributes">Ignoring Model Attributes</h3>

<p>Railroader assumes database values are suspect (and so should you). But for some applications this does not make sense. Use the <code>--ignore-model-output</code> option to suppress reporting model attributes as cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.</p>
