<h3 id="testing-on-different-platforms">Testing on Different Platforms</h3>

<p>Railroader should work on most platforms without a problem. It is typically tested against MRI 1.8.7 and 1.9.3, so any problems outside those two should definitely be <a href="http://github.com/david-a-wheeler/railroader/issues">reported</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contributing-features">Contributing Features</h3>

<p>New feature implementations should be submitted as a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/railroader">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contributing-documentation">Contributing Documentation</h3>

<p>Documentation patches can be submitted as pull requests to the <a href="https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/railroader-site">railroader-site</a> repository.</p>

<h3 id="false-negatives-and-false-positives">False Negatives and False Positives</h3>

<p>If you have code that raises warnings when it shouldn&rsquo;t, or does not raise warnings when it should, please consider reporting them with code which reproduces the problem.</p>

<p>See <a href="/docs/contributing/adding_tests">here</a> for how to add tests to demonstrate these issues.</p>

<h3 id="creating-new-checks">Creating New Checks</h3>

<p>Each check that Railroader runs is a separate class contained in <code>lib/railroader/checks/check_*.rb</code>. Some of these are very simple. For example, see the <a href="https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/railroader/blob/master/lib/railroader/checks/check_strip_tags.rb">StripTags</a> check.</p>

<p>New checks can be added simply by writing a new check and placing it in that directory. For best results, subclass from <code>BaseCheck</code> and follow the naming convention of starting the class name with <code>Check</code>.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-success">Reporting Success</h3>
