  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Changes since 1.7.1</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support relative paths in reports (fsword)</li>
<li>Allow Brakeman to be run without tty (fsword)</li>
<li>Fix exit code with <code>--compare</code> (fsword)</li>
<li>Fix <code>--rake</code> option (Deepak Kumar)</li>
<li>Add high confidence warnings for <code>to_json</code> XSS (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Fix <code>redirect_to</code> false negative</li>
<li>Fix duplicate warnings with <code>raw</code> calls</li>
<li>Fix shadowing of rendered partials</li>
<li>Add &#8220;render chain&#8221; to HTML reports</li>
<li>Add check for XSS in <code>content_tag</code></li>
<li>Add full backtrace for errors in debug mode</li>
<li>Treat model attributes in <code>or</code> expressions as immediate values</li>
<li>Switch to method access for Sexp nodes</li>
</ul>


<h3>Relative Paths in Reports</h3>

<p>The <code>--relative-paths</code> option will now cause Brakeman to output relative paths for warnings in reports in either JSON or tabs format. This is useful when comparing reports run on different machines or just in different directories.</p>

<h3>Brakeman without TTY</h3>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://fsword.github.com/">fsword</a>, Brakeman can now run without a TTY available.</p>

<h3>Exit Code for Compare</h3>

<p>Also thanks to fsword, Brakeman will return a proper exit code when run with <code>-z --compare</code>. If any changes are found, the exit code will be nonzero.</p>

<h3>Rake Task Generation Fixed</h3>

<p>The <code>--rake</code> option was broken, but <a href="https://github.com/deepakinseattle">Deepak Kumar</a> noticed and fixed it!</p>

<h3>High Confidence Warnings for JSON</h3>

<p>Older versions of Rails default to not escaping <code>to_json</code> calls, leading to <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/docs/warning_types/cross_site_scripting_to_json/">cross site scripting problems</a>. Since Rails 2.1.0, Rails has provided an option to escape JSON output by default. Brakeman will check this option, and warn on unescaped <code>to_json</code> calls.</p>

<h3>Fix Redirect False Negative</h3>

<p>Brakeman was incorrectly checking for <code>:only_path =&gt; true</code> in <em>any</em> argument to <code>redirect_to</code>. However, it is only valid as part of the first argument.</p>

<h3>Fix Duplicate Warnings on Raw Calls</h3>

<p>A logic mistake sometimes caused a high and weak confidence warning to be reported for the same code using <code>raw</code>. This has been fixed.</p>

<h3>Fix Shadowing of Rendered Partials</h3>

<p>Due to the way Brakeman was storing rendered partials, a view that was rendered multiple times via different code paths would only store a single instance of the rendered view. This could result in some vulnerabilities not being reported.</p>

<p>To fix this, Brakeman now stores the entire &#8220;render chain&#8221; (that is, each location of a <code>render</code>). This ensures a unique key for each rendered template.</p>

<h3>Report Render Chain in HTML</h3>

<p>HTML reports now have a new feature that reports the &#8220;render chain&#8221; for view warnings (if the chain is more than a single call deep).</p>

<p>A warning like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unexpanded_call_chain.png" alt="Unexpanded" /></p>

<p>Might expand to show this chain:</p>

<p><img src="/images/expanded_call_chain.png" alt="Expanded" /></p>

<h3>Check for XSS in <code>content_tag</code></h3>

<p><code>content_tag</code> is a view helper for generating HTML tags containing some content. In Rails 2.x, <code>content_tag</code> did not escape this content. In Rails 3.x, this changed so that now it is escaped. While <code>content_tag</code> does have an <code>escape</code> parameter (true by default), this only applies to the tag attribute <em>values</em>.</p>

<p>Brakeman now warns on possible cross site scripting via <code>content_tag</code> calls. <a href="/docs/warning_types/content_tag">See here</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Backtraces in Debug Mode</h3>

<p>By default, Brakeman tries its best to recover from errors and produce a report. However, this can sometimes make it difficult to track down the sources of errors. Now, with the <code>-d</code> option, Brakeman will report backtraces for errors encountered while running, as well as including backtraces in HTML reports.</p>

<h3>Convenience Methods for Sexp Access</h3>

<p>Previously, all code dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-exp">s-expressions</a> in the <code>Sexp</code> class accessed nodes via array access, e.g. <code>exp[1]</code> or <code>exp[2]</code>. This led to hard-to-read code like <code>exp[2][3][1][1..-1]</code>. This release includes convenience methods to replace those types of calls. Available methods are <a href="http://rdoc.info/gems/brakeman/Sexp">documented here</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully this leads to code that is both easier to read and easier to write.</p>

<h3>Reporting Problems</h3>

<p>This release touches a lot of code (76 changed files with 1,515 additions and 598 deletions), so there is ample opportunity for bugs to sneak in. Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a>!</p>

</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a small release to add checks for the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/8/9/ann-rails-3-2-8-has-been-released/">Rails vulnerabilities reported last week</a>.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.7.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/fV3QUToSMSw/discussion">CVE-2012-3463</a></li>
<li>Add check for <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/kKGNeMrnmiY/discussion">CVE-2012-3464</a></li>
<li>Add check for <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/FgVEtBajcTY/discussion">CVE-2012-3465</a></li>
<li>Add charset to HTML report (<a href="https://github.com/hooopo">hooopo</a>)</li>
<li>Report XSS in select() for Rails 2</li>
</ul>


<h3>CVE-2012-3463 - XSS in select_tag Prompt</h3>

<p>In Rails 3.x, values supplied to the <code>:prompt</code> option in the <code>select_tag</code> helper are not escaped, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.</p>

<p>Brakeman will warn on all uses of <code>select_tag</code> with unescaped user input in the <code>:prompt</code> option.</p>

<h3>CVE-2012-3464 - Single Quotes are Unescaped</h3>

<p>This is pretty much a known issue (<a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/166894">example from 2008</a>), but Rails 3.2.8 fixes it.</p>

<p>Single quotes are most dangerous when interpolating values into HTML attributes that use single quotes, which is why it is often recommended to always use double quotes in HTML.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/kKGNeMrnmiY/discussion">provided workaround</a> for earlier versions of Rails which replaces <code>ERB::Util.html_escape</code> with <code>Rack::Utils.escape_html</code>. This method adds escaping for both single quotes (<code>'</code>) and forward slashes (<code>/</code>).</p>

<p>If the provided workaround is used in an initializer, as suggested, then Brakeman will not generate a warning for this vulnerability. Otherwise, Brakeman will generate a warning for affected versions.</p>

<h3>CVE-2012-3465 - XSS in strip_tags</h3>

<p>Another vulnerability has been reported for <code>strip_tags</code> (earlier report was <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/K5EwdJt06hI/discussion">CVE-2011-2931</a>).</p>

<p>Brakeman will warn on affected versions if uses of <code>strip_tags</code> are detected.</p>

<h3>XSS in select Helper</h3>

<p>This vulnerability was <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/CdoMUVpsRmQ/discussion">reported a while ago</a>, but it was unclear if it applied to Rails 2.x or just Rails 3. Thanks to Neil Matatall, it has been confirmed to be an issue in Rails 2.x as well.</p>

<p>Therefore, Brakeman will be reporting the vulnerability (<code>select</code> does not escape options list if supplied as a straight string) for Rails 2.x as well.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a> with this release!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This release includes improvements to Rails 3 route processing, better performance, several bug fixes, and more!</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.6.2</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for CVE-2012-3424</li>
<li>Link report types to descriptions on website</li>
<li>Report errors raised while running check</li>
<li>Improve processing of Rails 3 routes</li>
<li>Improve file access check</li>
<li>Avoid warning on non-ActiveModel models</li>
<li>Fix how <code>params[:x] ||=</code> is handled</li>
<li>Treat user input in <code>or</code> expressions as immediate values</li>
<li>Fix processing of negative array indexes</li>
<li>Fix &#8220;empty char-class&#8221; error</li>
<li>Speed improvements by stripping down SexpProcessor</li>
<li>Add line breaks to truncated table rows</li>
</ul>


<h3>Check for HTTP Auth Digest DoS</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/vxJjrc15qYM/discussion">CVE-2012-3424</a>, a potential denial of service vulnerability in how Rails handles HTTP authentication digest parameters, was recently announced. It affects Rails 3.x, and is fixed in 3.0.16, 3.1.7, and 3.2.7.</p>

<p>Brakeman will generate a warning for the Rails versions affected, but will only report a high confidence warning if <code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code> or <code>authenticate_with_http_digest</code> methods are called.</p>

<h3>Links to Warning Information</h3>

<p>HTML reports now link warning types to descriptions on the Brakeman website. JSON reports will also include the link information. Due to this change, it is not possible to compare JSON reports from previous versions using the <code>--compare</code> option.</p>

<p>Suggestions and <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman-site">pull requests</a> for improving the documention are welcome!</p>

<h3>Report Check Errors</h3>

<p>Previously, errors encounted while running checks were not included in reports. This has been fixed.</p>

<h3>Better Rails 3 Route Processing</h3>

<p>Even the simple information Brakeman uses (which methods are routes) is difficult to extract from Rails 3 routes due to all the different options it offers. This release should decrease the number of &#8220;Error while processing routes&#8221; messages that come up.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/116">this pull request</a> for more information about specific fixes.</p>

<h3>Improved File Access Check</h3>

<p>The check for user input in file access calls has been improved so the confidence of the warnings will vary according to how the user input is used, like most other checks.</p>

<p>Additionally, the check will now respect the <code>--report-direct</code> option.</p>

<h3>No SQLi Warnings for Non-ActiveModel</h3>

<p>Models which do not inherit from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> will no longer be reported in SQL injection warnings.</p>

<h3>Default Assignment to <code>params</code></h3>

<p>Normally, when Brakeman processes an assignment like <code>x ||= y</code>, it will assign <code>y</code> to <code>x</code> if no previous value is found for <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>However, in this case:</p>

<pre><code>params[:x] ||= y
</code></pre>

<p>The information that the left hand side is a <code>params</code> hash is lost.</p>

<p>This has been changed so default assignment to a <code>params</code> hash will not replace the entire value, but will handle it as <code>params[:x] || y</code>.</p>

<h3>User Input in <code>or</code> Expressions</h3>

<p>Previously, unescaped output like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= params[:x] || z %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>would have been reported as a weak confidence warning. This has been changed so that any user input in an <code>or</code> expression will be considered immediate (versus &#8220;indirect&#8221;) output and will likely result in high confidence warnings.</p>

<h3>Speed Improvements</h3>

<p>Scan times should decrease by 15-25% with this release. This is mostly due to stripping unused bits out of SexpProcessor.</p>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<p>Besides errors raised when processing Rails 3 routes, the <code>Result must be a Sexp, was Symbol::array</code> and <code>empty char-class</code> errors should be resolved now.</p>

<p>Please report any errors raised when performing scans, as they are usually bugs.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a> with this release!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Besides checks for the latest CVEs, this release includes a slightly improved redirect check, noiser output with <code>--compare</code>, and better handling of <code>before_filter</code>.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.6.1</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add checks for CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2661, CVE-2012-2694, CVE-2012-2695 (Dave Worth)</li>
<li>Avoid warning when redirecting to a model instance</li>
<li>Raise confidence level for model attributes in redirects</li>
<li>Add <code>request.parameters</code> as a parameters hash</li>
<li>Return non-zero exit code when missing dependencies</li>
<li>Fix <code>before_filter :except</code> logic</li>
<li>Only accept symbol literals as before_filter names</li>
<li>Cache before_filter lookups</li>
<li>Turn off quiet mode by default for <code>--compare</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Latest CVEs</h3>

<p>A number of Rails vulnerabilities were announced recently, although there are really only two issues.</p>

<p>One issue is that query parameters like <code>?name[]</code> and <code>?name[]=1&amp;name[]</code> get converted to <code>{"name" =&gt; [nil]}</code> and <code>{"name" =&gt; ["1", nil]}</code>. This, in turn, causes ActiveRecord to produce SQL queries with either <code>IS NULL</code> or <code>IN ('1', NULL)</code>. This is probably unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>The other issue is that query parameters like <code>?name[users.id]=1</code> or <code>?name[users][id]=1</code> get converted to <code>{"name" =&gt; { "users.id" =&gt; 1 }}</code> or <code>{"name" =&gt; { "users" =&gt; { "id" =&gt; 1 }}}</code>. ActiveRecord interprets <code>"users.id"</code> and <code>"users" =&gt; { "id" ...}</code> as <code>"users"."id"</code> in the WHERE clause, allowing an attacker to control the table/columns being queried.</p>

<p>Updated versions for Rails 3.x have been released.</p>

<p>For Rails 2.3, I believe <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/rails/pull/1/files">these changes</a> will fix the first issue, and there is another <a href="https://rubyonrails-security.googlegroups.com/attach/aee3413fb038bf56/2-3-sql-injection.patch?view=1&amp;part=3">patch available</a> for the second issue.</p>

<p>Older versions of Rails 2.x may be vulnerable to the &#8220;NULL&#8221; issue, but not to the nested hashes problem.</p>

<h3>Unprotected Redirect Check</h3>

<p>There have been some minor changes to <code>CheckRedirect</code>. In most cases, it should no longer warn when redirecting to a model instance. If there are still false positives with this scenario, please report them.</p>

<p>The other change is that redirects to model attributes will now be marked as high confidence, instead of weak.</p>

<h3>Exit Code on Missing Dependencies</h3>

<p>Brakeman catches errors from missing dependencies in order to show a nicer error message. Unfortunately, it was also returning <code>0</code> on exit. This is undesirable behavior when chaining commands together.</p>

<p>This has been changed to return a non-zero exit code.</p>

<h3>Before Filter Changes</h3>

<p>There were some isues with how <code>before_filter</code> was being handled. The logic when using <code>:except</code> was broken, causing Brakeman to treat it like <code>:only</code>.</p>

<p>The other issue caused Brakeman to interpret arguments such as method calls as method names. For example, <code>before_filter blah</code> would be treated like <code>before_filter :blah</code>.</p>

<p>While dealing with this, caching of filter lookups was also added for a minor performance improvement.</p>

<h3>Noisier <code>--compare</code></h3>

<p>Using the <code>--compare</code> option now shows the same output as a regular scan. If you are piping the output of <code>--compare</code> to a file or elsewhere, you may wish to use the <code>--quiet</code> option.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a> with this release!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, it&#8217;s been over a month since the last release!</p>

<p>The major change in this version is a rewrite of the SQL injection check. Many more methods are covered, and there should be a reduction of false positives as well.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.6.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Major rewrite of CheckSQL</li>
<li>Process actions mixed into controllers</li>
<li>Check for inherited <code>attr_accessible</code> (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Handle <code>render :template =&gt; ...</code></li>
<li>Report line number of highlighted value, if available</li>
<li>Fix highlighting of HTML escaped values in HTML report</li>
<li>Fix rescanning of deleted templates</li>
</ul>


<h3>Updated SQL Injection Check</h3>

<p><code>CheckSQL</code> has been completely revamped. Brakeman now has a much better understanding of the various ActiveRecord::FinderMethods and ActiveRecord::QueryMethods, as well as their options.</p>

<p>The check is also more conservative about what it warns on. Previously, since string interpolation is the main entry point for SQL injection in Rails, any interpolated value in a query would generate a warning. Now, &#8220;safe&#8221; sanitization methods, obviously safe methods like <code>to_i</code> and <code>id</code>, constants, strings, and other literal values should not cause warnings.</p>

<p>The &#8220;highlighted&#8221; value (or &#8220;user input&#8221;) reported for SQL warnings should be much more accurate now, making it easier to determine why a warning was reported.</p>

<h3>Controller Mixins</h3>

<p>Methods on controller mixins that are used as actions should now be processed as if they were defined in the controller itself.</p>

<h3>Check for Inherited Mass Assignment Protection</h3>

<p>Since mass assignment protection via <code>attr_accessible</code> is inheritable, Brakeman will no longer warn about models whose parent uses <code>attr_accessible</code>.</p>

<h3>Template Option in Render</h3>

<p>Somehow, the <code>:template</code> option for <code>render</code> has been ignored this whole time. Sorry!</p>

<h3>Better Line Numbers</h3>

<p>Warnings which have a <code>:user_input</code> field use that value to &#8220;highlight&#8221; part of the code in the reported warning. This value usually corresponds to the code which actually caused the warning to be generated.</p>

<p>If a warning has this field, the line number of that code is used, instead of the starting line number of the entire piece of code. This often leads to more accurate and helpful line numbers.</p>

<h3>Highlighted Values in HTML Reports</h3>

<p>Since the warnings output in HTML reports are HTML-escaped, there was a sometimes mismatch between the value that needed to be highlighted and the HTML warning output, causing nothing to be highlighted. This is fixed now.</p>

<h3>Rescanning of Deleted Templates</h3>

<p>In the rescanning logic, templates which are related to a changed file (a view or partial that is rendered, usually) will be rescanned. However, there is the possibility that the template which needs to be rescanned as a related file has been deleted as part of the set of changes. This caused the rescanning to blow up, but that has been fixed now.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a> with this release!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of code has changed in this release, particularly with the removal of the Ruport library for reporting. While Ruport worked pretty well, it caused some issues just due to the large number of (out-dated) dependencies it brought with it.</p>

<p>Also, this release changes the JSON report output. This is a backwards <em>incompatible</em> change. But, given how useless the previous JSON reports were, hopefully this will not affect too many people.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.3:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the Ruport dependency (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add more informational JSON output (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add comparison to previous JSON report (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add highlighting of dangerous values in HTML/text reports</li>
<li><code>Model#update_attribute</code> should not raise mass assignment warning (Dave Worth)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t check <code>find_by_*</code> method for SQL injection</li>
<li>Fix duplicate reporting of mass assignment and SQL injection</li>
<li>Fix rescanning of deleted files</li>
<li>Properly check for <code>rails_xss</code> in Gemfile</li>
</ul>


<h3>No More Ruport</h3>

<p>Ruport is a nice library, but it also has not been updated in over two years and its dependency tree was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Thanks to Neil Matatall, Brakeman no longer depends on Ruport, but the reports should look essentially the same. The HTML reports are now rendered through ERB templates, so it should not be too difficult to customize the reports if desired.</p>

<h3>Better JSON Output</h3>

<p>JSON output now includes meta-information about the scan, errors raised during the scan, and line numbers for each warning.</p>

<h3>JSON Report Comparison</h3>

<p>Being able to compare Brakeman reports is essential for tracking warnings over time. Prior to this release, the only decent way of doing that was via the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/docs/jenkins/">Jenkins plugin</a>. But now Brakeman can compare results to the JSON report from a previous scan.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>brakeman -o report.json
brakeman --compare report.json
</code></pre>

<p>This will run another scan, then output a comparison of the reports (in JSON). The report includes a list of fixed warnings and a list of new warnings that were found.</p>

<h3>User Input Highlighted in Reports</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is unclear exactly what value has caused Brakeman to issue a particular warning. This release adds highlighting the detected user input in most warnings. (Some warnings, the code that is reported <em>is</em> the detected user input). This information is also available in the JSON reports.</p>

<p><img src="/images/user_input_highlight.png" title="Example of User Input Highlighting" alt="User Input Highlight" /></p>

<h3>Fewer Mass Assignment and SQL Injection Methods</h3>

<p>Dave Worth pointed out that Brakeman was a little overzealous in which methods it considered susceptible to mass assignment and SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>Brakeman will no longer check <code>update_attribute</code> for mass assignment or the <code>find_by_*</code> dynamic methods for SQL injection.</p>

<h3>Fewer Mass Assignment and SQL Injection Duplicates</h3>

<p>Pesky duplicate reports of mass assignment and SQL injection were turning up as template warnings. This occurred when the results of the mass assignment or SQL query were assigned to a variable which was then used in a template. This should now be fixed.</p>

<p>More details than are probably desired are available <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/82">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Rescanning Fixes</h3>

<p>Rescanning of deleted files is now supported, and there some other issues with rescanning that are now resolved as well.</p>

<h3>New Logo</h3>

<p>Brakeman has a sweet new logo, thanks to <a href="http://janellelawless.com/">Janelle Lawless</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/images/logo_medium.png" alt="Brakeman Logo" /></p>

<p>Updates to the website to reflect this awesomeness are coming soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A considerable number of bugs and odd cases have been fixed with this release, and one new check has been added. Upgrading is <em>always</em> recommended!</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for user input in <code>Object#send</code> (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Support output to multiple formats (Nick Green)</li>
<li>Prevent infinite loops in mutually recursive templates</li>
<li>Only check <code>eval</code> arguments for user input, not the call target</li>
<li>Handle <code>render :layout</code> in views</li>
<li>Search subdirectories for models</li>
<li>Set values in request hashes and propagate to views</li>
<li>Add rake task file to gemspec (Anton Ageev)</li>
<li>Filter rescanning of templates (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Improve handling of modules and nesting</li>
<li>Test for zero errors in test reports</li>
</ul>


<h3>New Check for User Input in Object#send</h3>

<p>This new check looks for instances where user input can be used to control the method called using <code>send</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>user = User.find(params[:user][:id])
method = params[:user][:action].to_sym
user.send(method)
</code></pre>

<h3>Support for Multiple Output Formats</h3>

<p>Brakeman can now accept multiple <code>-o</code> arguments in order to produce more than one report from the same scan:</p>

<pre><code>brakeman -o report.html -o report.json
</code></pre>

<h3>Handle Mutually Recursive Templates</h3>

<p>In some cases where two templates would render each other as partials, it would cause infinite loops in Brakeman. This is now fixed, at least for the simple common case:</p>

<p>_one.erb.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; 'two' %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>_two.erb.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; 'one' %&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Only Check <code>eval</code> Arguments</h3>

<p>Previously, Brakeman was checking the entire call to methods like <code>eval</code> or <code>class_eval</code> for user input. This led to false positives when <code>class_eval</code> was being called on a model.</p>

<p>Now Brakeman only checks the arguments or block provided to the <code>eval</code> call.</p>

<h3>Handle render :layout in views</h3>

<p>Brakeman was not handling <code>render :layout =&gt; "..."</code> in views properly. This led to errors like:</p>

<pre><code>wrong number of arguments (0 for 1): /Users/collins/work/brakeman/lib/brakeman/processors/lib/render_helper.rb:14:in `template_name
</code></pre>

<p><code>render :layout</code> is now handled just like rendering a partial.</p>

<h3>Search for Models in Subdirectories</h3>

<p>Brakeman was only searching <code>app/models/</code> for models, but not any subdirectories. Now it does!</p>

<h3>Propagate Request Values</h3>

<p>While Brakeman has always detected request values (e.g., query parameters) in views, it would not propagate values stored IN those request hashes.</p>

<p>For example, if an action in a controller did this:</p>

<pre><code>params[:input] = some_random_value
</code></pre>

<p>That value would not be propagated to the view if the view used <code>params[:input]</code>.</p>

<h3>Add Rake Task to Gemspec</h3>

<p>In 1.2.0, Brakeman added the <code>--rake</code> option to add a Rake task to a Rails application, but the actual task itself was not included in the gem!</p>

<p>Thanks to Anton Ageev for pointing this out. Either no one else tried this option, or a lot of people were very disappointed.</p>

<h3>Filter Templates When Rescanning</h3>

<p>When rescanning (for example, with <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-brakeman">guard-brakeman</a>), Brakeman was assuming any files in <code>app/views</code> is a template, but this isn&#8217;t always true.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a>!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is update includes some important fixes. All users of the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin are particularly encouraged to upgrade.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix handling of views when using <code>rails_xss</code></li>
<li>Fix rescanning of lib files (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Fix <code>link_to</code> checks for Rails 2.0 and 2.3</li>
<li>Revert to <code>ruby_parser</code> 2.3.1 for Ruby 1.8 parsing</li>
<li>Only warn on user input in render paths</li>
<li>Output stack trace on interrupt when debugging</li>
<li>Ignore user input in if statement conditions</li>
<li>Fix &#8211;skip-files option with Ruby 1.8</li>
</ul>


<h3>Views with rails_xss</h3>

<p>Some previous changes to make sure Brakeman was processing ERB views the same way as the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin unfortunately broke the processing of those views.</p>

<p>These changes caused Brakeman to not report <em>any</em> output from ERB views when the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin was in use, hiding any XSS vulnerabilities in those views.</p>

<p>This now fixed, so if you are using the <code>rails_xss</code> plugin, it is highly recommended to upgrade.</p>

<h3>Rescanning lib/ Files</h3>

<p>Rescanning changed files in the <code>lib</code> directory was broken, but Neil fixed it!</p>

<h3>link_to Checks</h3>

<p>In Rails 2.3, the URL is escaped, but not the body of the link. In Rails 2.0, neither argument is escaped.</p>

<p>In this release, the check for XSS in <code>link_to</code> has been updated to handle <code>link_to</code> with blocks and to warn in Rails 2.0.x if any user input is used as an argument.</p>

<h3>Revert to ruby_parser for Ruby 1.8</h3>

<p>Brakeman has been using a vendored version of <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser">ruby_parser</a> with some updates to Ruby 1.9 syntax parsing. Unfortunately, that version also introduced some regressions for parsing Ruby 1.8 syntax.</p>

<p>To handle this, Brakeman will now only use the vendored version for 1.9 parsing, but the regular gem version for 1.8 syntax parsing. This should fix some parse errors people are seeing for Ruby 1.8 apps.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Render Path Updates</h3>

<p>The check for dynamic render paths was not very good, but it is better now. &#8220;Dynamic Render Path&#8221; warnings should only be raised when user input is actually used to determine what view, partial, or file to render.</p>

<h3>Stacktrace Output</h3>

<p>Brakeman will now output a stacktrace if interrupted while running with the <code>-d</code> option. This is mostly helpful when Brakeman appears to &#8220;hang&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">issues</a>!</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/brakeman">@brakeman</a> on Twitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the excitment yesterday with a mass assignment vulnerability being exploited in a very public manner on <a href="https://gist.github.com/1978249">Github</a>, interest in Brakeman has skyrocketed.</p>

<p>This lead to re-examination of Brakeman&#8217;s code for detecting that mass assignment has been globally disabled - and it turns out there was a bug or two. So here is a bug-fix release of Brakeman to correct that and some other minor issues.</p>

<p>Upgrading to 1.5.1 may increase the number of warnings reported.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.5.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix detection of global mass assignment setting</li>
<li>Fix partial rendering in Rails 3</li>
<li>Show backtrace when interrupt received (Ruby 1.9 only)</li>
<li>More debug output</li>
<li>Internal fixes:

<ul>
<li>Remove duplicate method in Brakeman::Rails2XSSErubis</li>
<li>Add tracking of module and class to Brakeman::BaseProcessor</li>
<li>Report module when using Brakeman::FindCall</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mass Assignment</h3>

<p>Mass assignment is not a particularly new issue, but the amount of attention suddenly focused on it this weekend was amazing.</p>

<p>This release of Brakeman can detect three different methods for defaulting all models to a whitelist of allowed attributes that can be mass assigned.</p>

<p>The first is probably the most widely-seen version. In an intializer, do</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::Base.send(:attr_accessible, nil)
</code></pre>

<p>The second is essentially equivalent, but 1.5.1 adds support for it as well:</p>

<pre><code>module ActiveRecord
  class Base
    attr_accessible nil
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The third option is only available for Rails 3.1.0 and newer. The following configuration setting can be added to <code>application.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true
</code></pre>

<p>Brakeman should correctly detect all of these.</p>

<p><a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/secure-your-rails-apps/">This is a very nice post</a> explaining the dangers of mass assignment (mentioning Brakeman is nice, too.)</p>

<h3>Partials in Rails 3</h3>

<p>In Rails 3, <code>render 'blah'</code> is now equivalent to <code>render :partial =&gt; 'blah'</code> when used inside a template.</p>

<p>Brakeman now supports this correctly.</p>

<h3>Debug Output</h3>

<p>More debugging output has been added for use with the <code>-d</code> option.</p>

<p>Additionally, when interrupting the application (for example, with <code>^C</code>), a stack trace will be output. Please note, however, that this only works with Ruby 1.9.</p>

<h3>Internal Changes</h3>

<p>There have been a few internal changes. There is a possibility that these will affect some warnings. However, it should only result in accurate reporting of class names.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any problems on <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues">Github</a>!</p>
