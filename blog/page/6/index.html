  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Railroader 2.0 is here! While it does include a lot of updates, the &#8220;2.0&#8221; is mostly to indicate this release includes some changes which may break external tools (also, who wants a version &#8220;1.10&#8221;?). Tool maintainers are encouraged to avoid dependencies on warning messages and types (use the &#8220;warning code&#8221; instead), and to use warning fingerprints + line numbers for comparing warnings.</p>

<p>Lots more features are on the horizon for the 2.x family!</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.9.5</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove &#8220;timestamp&#8221; key from JSON reports</li>
<li>Relative paths are used by default in JSON reports</li>
<li><code>--absolute-paths</code> replaces <code>--relative-paths</code></li>
<li>Fix fingerprint generation to actually use the file path</li>
<li>Clean up SQL CVE warning messages</li>
<li>Remove deprecated config file locations</li>
<li>Add <code>--only-files</code> option to specify files/paths to scan (<a href="https://github.com/ehlertij">Ian Ehlert</a>)</li>
<li>Add Marshal/CSV deserialization check</li>
<li>Combine Marshal/YAML/CSV deserialization checks into single check</li>
<li>Avoid duplicate &#8220;Dangerous Send&#8221; and &#8220;Unsafe Reflection&#8221; warnings</li>
<li>Avoid duplicate results for Symbol DoS check</li>
<li>Medium confidence for mass assignment to <code>attr_protected</code> models</li>
<li>Only treat classes with names containing <code>Controller</code> like controllers</li>
<li>Better handling of classes nested inside controllers</li>
<li>Better handling of controller classes nested in classes/modules</li>
<li>Handle <code>-&gt;</code> lambdas with no arguments (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/331">#331</a>)</li>
<li>Handle explicit block argument destructuring</li>
<li>Skip Rails config options that are real objects (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/324">#324</a>)</li>
<li>Detect Rails 3 JSON escape config option</li>
<li>Much better tracking of warning file names</li>
<li>Fix errors when using <code>--separate-models</code> (<a href="https://github.com/noahd1">Noah Davis</a>)</li>
<li>Fix text report console output in JRuby (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/229">#229</a>)</li>
<li>Fix false positives on <code>Model#id</code></li>
<li>Fix false positives on <code>params.to_json</code></li>
<li>Fix model path guesses to use &#8220;models/&#8221; instead of &#8220;controllers/&#8221;</li>
<li>Use exceptions instead of abort in railroader lib (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/230">#230</a>)</li>
<li>Update to Ruby2Ruby 2.0.5</li>
</ul>


<h3>JSON Report Changes</h3>

<p>Several changes were made to JSON reports in this release. The <code>["scan_info"]["timestamp"]</code> key was removed, since it was just a duplicate of <code>["scan_info"]["end_time"]</code>.</p>

<p>JSON reports now default to reporting relative paths for file names in warnings, which seems to be more useful for external tools. Because of this change, the <code>--relative-paths</code> option has been removed and replaced with <code>--absolute-paths</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/333">timestamp change</a>, <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/330">relative paths change</a>)</p>

<h3>Fingerprint Generation</h3>

<p>The previous release had a bug where fingerprints were not really including the file name as part of the fingerprint. This has been resolved, and fingerprints should be a reliable way of tracking warnings now.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/317">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Warning Messages</h3>

<p>The warning messages for SQL CVEs were unnecessarily verbose, so they have been trimmed down. Of course, this shouldn&#8217;t affect anyone, because all apps have upgraded to Rails versions without reported vulnerabilities, right?</p>

<p>Some small changes have been made to other warning messages. Please do not rely on warning messages remaining constant. To track warnings, use the <code>warning_code</code> attribute which will never change.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/334">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Config File Default Locations</h3>

<p>The following locations will no longer be automatically searched for Railroader configuration files:</p>

<pre><code>* `./config.yaml`
* `.railroader/config.yaml`
* `/etc/railroader/config.yaml`
* The Railroader `lib/` directory
</code></pre>

<p>The following locations are still used:</p>

<pre><code>* `./config/railroader.yml`
* `~/.railroader/config.yml`
* `/etc/railroader/config.yml`
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, Railroader can use configuration files. See <code>railroader --help</code> for details.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/310">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Limiting Scans</h3>

<p>While individual files can be exempted from a scan using <code>--skip-files</code>, the new <code>--only-files</code> option can limit scans to a set of files and directories, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ehlertij">Ian Ehlert</a>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/316">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Deserialization Checks</h3>

<p>Railroader now checks for deserialization of user input using <code>Marshal</code>, <code>YAML</code>, and <code>CSV</code>. The former <code>YAMLLoad</code> check has been merged into the new <code>CheckDeserialize</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/329">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fewer Duplicate Warnings</h3>

<p>A few new checks (symbol DoS, dangerous sends, and unsafe reflection) were generating a lot of duplicate warnings. This has been fixed.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/338">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Nested Classes and Controllers</h3>

<p>Railroader&#8217;s previous approach to nested classes was to ignore them. But it appears some people use classes as namespaces and place important classes (like controllers) inside them. This release changes how Railroader deals with nested classes, as well as classes that inherit from <code>ApplicationController</code> but do not have <code>Controller</code> in their name. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/325">pull request</a> for details.</p>

<p>Hopefully this means more accurate scans, but please report any correct warnings from earlier versions missing in 2.0.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/325">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>&#8220;Stabby&#8221; Lambdas with No Arguments</h3>

<p>Errors like <code>undefined method 'each' for 0:Fixnum</code> caused by use of <code>-&gt;</code> lambdas with zero arguments should be fixed now.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/332">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Explicit Block Argument Destructuring</h3>

<p>Explicit block argument destructuring like this:</p>

<pre><code>blah do |x, (y,z)|
end
</code></pre>

<p>used to be ignored, but now the arguments are handled in order to keep block arguments in their proper scope.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/307/">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Rails 3 Config Processing</h3>

<p>Railroader only cares about Rails configuration processing to check for specific settings. It converts a setting like <code>config.a.b.z</code> to a hash entry like <code>[:config][:a][:b][:z]</code>. However, if real values are found for <code>config.a.b</code> this messes things up. So for now they are ignored.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/326">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Errors from Separating Models</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/noahd1">Noah Davis</a> fixed an error where file names were not being properly set when using the <code>--separate-models</code> option.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/313">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Better File Tracking</h3>

<p>Files associated with warnings should be more accurate now, as file information is better preserved during processing.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/318">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>JRuby Console Output</h3>

<p>The default text output to a console should now be working again in JRuby. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jeg2">JEG2</a> for pushing out a new version of <a href="http://highline.rubyforge.org/">HighLine</a>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/339">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Model#id and to_json False Positives</h3>

<p>There should be fewer warnings generated by <code>Model#id</code> and <code>to_json</code> calls on <code>params</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/309">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Exceptions instead of Abort</h3>

<p>A few instances of <code>abort</code> have been removed from Railroader and replaced with exceptions. This should make it easier to use Railroader as a library.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/335">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

      <p class="meta">




<time datetime="2013-04-05 08:42:00 -0400" pubdate  updated >Apr 5<span>th</span>, 2013</time>


</p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>As planned, Railroader 1.9.5 is mostly internal bug fixes and improvements, with the one exception being a new check for symbol creation from user input. Barring any emergencies, the next release will be 2.0.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.9.4</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for unsafe symbol creation (<a href="https://github.com/HonoreDB">Aaron Weiner</a>)</li>
<li>Do not warn on mass assignment with <code>slice</code>/<code>only</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/203">#203</a>)</li>
<li>Do not warn on session secret if in <code>.gitignore</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/241">#241</a>)</li>
<li>Fix session secret check for Rails 4</li>
<li>Fix scoping for blocks and block arguments</li>
<li>Fix error when modifying blocks in templates</li>
<li>Fix crash on <code>before_filter</code> outside controller</li>
<li>Fix <code>Sexp</code> hash cache invalidation</li>
<li>Respect <code>quiet</code> option in configuration file (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/300">#300</a>)</li>
<li>Convert assignment to simple <code>if</code> expressions to <code>or</code></li>
<li>More fixes for assignments inside branches</li>
<li>Refactoring of <code>CheckLinkTo</code> and <code>Report</code> (<a href="https://github.com/barttenbrinke">Bart ten Brinke</a>)</li>
<li>Pin ruby2ruby dependency to version 2.0.3 (<a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby2ruby/issues/15">see here</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Symbol Creation Check</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HonoreDB">Aaron Weiner</a> added a check for symbol creation from user input, such as <code>params[:x].to_i</code> which can lead to Denial of Service.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/296">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Mass Assignment with Select Keys</h3>

<p>A common pattern to avoid mass assignment issues is to use <code>slice</code> or <code>only</code> when passing in values to mass assignment methods. Railroader should no longer warn in these situations.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/303">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Ignoring Session Secrets</h3>

<p>Railroader no longer warns if the config file containing the session secret key is included in <code>.gitignore</code>. This only applies if the default file names are used.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/302">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Warn on Rails 4 Session Secrets</h3>

<p>Support for Rails 4 session secrets has been added, since the configuration for that changed again.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/302">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Block Scoping</h3>

<p>Correct scope for blocks is tricky, and there are also some differences between Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 for block arguments. For the most part, Railroader has ignored blocks, but this lead to some compounding issues with assignments in branches.</p>

<p>This release now treats all block arguments as local assignments <em>inside</em> the block and shadows any variables outside the block (this is Ruby 1.9 behavior). This should lead to some performance improvements where block arguments do shadow outer variables.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/305">changes and examples</a>)</p>

<h3>Sexp Hash Cache Invalidation</h3>

<p>Since Railroader does a ton of hash table lookups with s-expressions as keys, it caches <code>Sexp#hash</code> values. In some situations, these cached values were being invalidated when they did not need to be, and not being invalidated when they should have been.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/294">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Quiet Option</h3>

<p>Railroader will now be quiet if the option is set in a configuration file.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/306">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Assignments of If Expressions</h3>

<p>Simple if expression assigments such as <code>x = thing ? this : that</code> will now be converted to <code>x = this || that</code>. This should simplify some code reported with warnings as well as avoid warning on values in <code>if</code> conditions.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/295">changes and examples</a>)</p>

<h3>Assignments in If Expressions</h3>

<p>Assignments inside <code>if</code> branches cause Railroader to &#8220;branch&#8221; the values for a variable, since it could be two or more different values. However, this branching should only occur <em>after</em> both branches have been processed. Railroader 1.9.3 made it so values were not branched inside of a single branch, but there was still an issue where values branched in the <code>then</code> clause would be used in the <code>else</code> clause. This release fixes that issue and simplifies branching overall.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/297">changes and examples</a>)</p>

<h3>Refactoring Internals</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/barttenbrinke">Bart ten Brinke</a> has begun some work refactoring some of the many ugly parts of Railroader. Thanks!</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://railroaderscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/railroader">@railroader</a> on Twitter.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>Next up should be <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/Roadmap">Railroader 2.0</a> unless there needs to be another emergency release. Most of the changes for 2.0 are relatively minor, but break backwards compatibility in areas that may affect external tools. This includes cleaning up warning messages, removing duplicate information from JSON output, combining some checks, changing some defaults, and so on.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions for other breaking changes, please file an issue ASAP to get it into the next release!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another release forced out early due to Rails vulnerabilities reported today.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.9.3</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-1854</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-1855</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-1856</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-1857</li>
<li>Fix <code>--compare</code> to work with older versions</li>
<li>Add &#8220;no-referrer&#8221; to HTML report links</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t warn when invoking <code>send</code> on user input</li>
<li>Slightly faster cloning of Sexps</li>
<li>Detect another way to add <code>strong_parameters</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/288">#288</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Latest Reported Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>All CVE checks were included in <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/290">these changes</a>.</p>

<h4>CVE-2013-1854 - Symbol Denial of Service</h4>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/jgJ4cjjS8FE/BGbHRxnDRTIJ">CVE-2013-1854</a> is the creation of symbols when a hash is passed as the value to an ActiveRecord finder method.</p>

<p>Railroader will warn on this CVE if there are any models using ActiveRecord and the Rails version is vulnerable.</p>

<h4>CVE-2013-1855 - sanitize_css</h4>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/4_QHo4BqnN8/_RrdfKk12I4J">CVE-2013-1855</a> is a vulnerability in the <code>sanitize_css</code> method.</p>

<p>Railroader will warn on this CVE for each use of <code>sanitize_css</code> if the Rails version is vulnerable. Calls obviously sanitizing user input will be high confidence, other calls will be medium confidence.</p>

<h4>CVE-2013-1856 - JRuby XML Parser</h4>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/KZwsQbYsOiI/5kUV7dSCJGwJ">CVE-2013-1856</a> is a vulnerability in the default XML parser used when running Rails on JRuby.</p>

<p>Railroader will warn on this CVE if run with JRuby and the Rails version is vulnerable. It will not warn if the provided workaround (not patch) is used in an initializers.</p>

<h4>CVE-2013-1857 - sanitize</h4>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/zAAU7vGTPvI/1vZDWXqBuXgJ">CVE-2013-1857</a> is a vulnerability in the <code>sanitize</code> method which allows URLs to include JavaScript.</p>

<p>Railroader will warn on this CVE for each use of <code>sanitize</code> if the Rails version is vulnerable. Calls obviously sanitizing user input will be high confidence, other calls will be medium confidence.</p>

<h3>Fix JSON Compare</h3>

<p>The 1.9.3 release introduced several new keys for warnings in the JSON output, which then broke <code>--compare</code> when used with output from an older version. Despite <a href="https://twitter.com/railroader/status/307586866721460225">declaring this would not be fixed</a>, it has been fixed. <code>--compare</code> reverts to old behavior if a report is from an older version.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/284">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Remove Referrer from HTML Report Links</h3>

<p>All warning type links HTML reports now include the <code>rel="no-referrer"</code> option. This prevents referrer information from being passed along to the linked site (usually the <a href="http://railroaderscanner.org/">Railroader site</a>), which means people won&#8217;t see that you are putting your Railroader reports on the open internet&#8230;</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/286">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fewer Dangerous Send Warnings</h3>

<p>Now that Railroader warns on dangerous uses of <code>constantize</code> and friends, there is no reason to warn on uses of <code>send</code>, <code>try</code>, etc. with user input as a target. User input for the method name will continue to warn.</p>

<p>For example, this will no longer generate a warning:</p>

<pre><code>params[:name].try(:downcase)
</code></pre>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/285">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Faster Sexp Cloning</h3>

<p>Railroader spends a lot of time cloning <code>Sexp</code>s, so this version introduces a slightly faster custom method instead of <code>Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(...))</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/287">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Another Strong Paramter Initializer</h3>

<p>Railroader now detects this approach to adding the <code>strong_parameters</code> functionality:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include,  ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesProtection)
</code></pre>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/289">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://railroaderscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/railroader">@railroader</a> on Twitter.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>This unexpected release means the roadmap has shifted again. The <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/Roadmap">roadmap</a> still has one more release (1.9.5) planned before 2.0. The next release will likely only include bug and false positive fixes. Again, Railroader 2.0 will <em>definitely</em> include breaking changes, especially for JSON reports.</p>

</ul>


<h3>Warning Fingerprints and New Identifiers</h3>

<p><em>This is a breaking change: <code>railroader --compare</code> will not work with reports generated from earlier versions.</em></p>

<p>Tracking of new and fixed warnings is often required when integrating Railroader with other tools. Current approaches rely on fragile values such as the warning messages or formatting of the code output.</p>

<p>Additionally, warnings are grouped into large categories, such as &#8220;SQL Injection&#8221;. Sometimes more fine-grained categorization is required that does not rely on a value intended for display that may need to changed.</p>

<p>With these two issues in mind, warnings now have a &#8220;warning code&#8221; and a &#8220;fingerprint&#8221;. Warning codes are integers which will never change and provide more specific categorization of warnings. For example, each CVE has a separate code. This should make tracking and sorting warnings easier, but also allow for fixes to warning category names in the future.</p>

<p>The warning fingerprint is a SHA256 hash of five values:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warning code</li>
<li>S-expression of code that caused the warning</li>
<li>Location (i.e., template name or class/method)</li>
<li>Relative file path</li>
<li>Confidence level</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that line numbers are <em>not</em> included. Identical warnings on different lines will have the same fingerprint. External tools can make the decision for how to handle this situation.</p>

<p>Warning fingerprints allow quick comparison of warnings (either by fingerprint, or fingerprint + line number) but are also less fragile than existing approaches. The fingerprint will not change if the warning category (meant for display) changes, if the formatting of the code changes, or if the line number changes (e.g., some blank lines are added at the top of a file).</p>

<p>If there are any issues with fingerprints, please report them before Railroader 2.0!</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/280">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Check for Unsafe Constant Creation</h3>

<p>Gabriel Quadros has contributed a check for methods that create constants (usually classes) from user input. <a href="http://blog.conviso.com.br/2013/02/exploiting-unsafe-reflection-in.html">His blog post</a> on the subject provides a good explanation of why this should be considered very dangerous.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/274">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Support for Slim</h3>

<p>Support for templates using <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">Slim</a> is now here! This should be considered experimental, as it has not yet been tested on a wide set of applications. Also, thanks <a href="https://github.com/tubaxenor">tubaxenor</a> for reporting a require issue with this change.</p>

<p>Please report any issues, especially false negatives!</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/271">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Check for Skipping of Authentication Methods</h3>

<p>The check for <code>skip_before_filter</code>s using <code>except</code> instead of <code>only</code> has been expanded to include authentication filters from popular libraries.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/268">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Render Paths in JSON Reports</h3>

<p>In HTML reports, templates which have a render path longer than one entry have been &#8220;expandable&#8221; to show the entire render path instead of just one level up. For example, a partial is usually rendered from a view, which is rendered from a controller action.</p>

<p>JSON reports now also include this information in the <code>render_path</code> value.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/279">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>No Empty Report Tables</h3>

<p>Owen Ben Davies contributed a patch to hide empty warning tables in the text and HTML reports. Looks much cleaner, thanks Owen!</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/282">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Handle (Pre|Ap)pended Filters</h3>

<p>Railroader will now recognize before filters added with <code>prepend_before_filter</code> and <code>append_before_filter</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/266">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Branching Performance Improvements</h3>

<p>It is entirely embarrassing, but Railroader stopped working on Redmine some time ago due to how assignments in <code>if</code> expressions are handled.</p>

<p>In order to be somewhat flow sensitive, Railroader combines variables assignments in <code>if</code> branches into <code>or</code> expressions. This captures the possible values a variable may have. However, Railroader was doing that for <em>every</em> assignment in an <code>if</code> branch, even if there were multiple assignments to the same variable in the same branch (i.e., the value was not actually branching since the assignments were sequential). This release fixes that issue.</p>

<p>Additionally, simple arithmetic operations are now distributed across <code>or</code> expressions containing simple values (strings or numbers at this point), providing some memory savings.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/270">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fix Processing of Production Environment Settings</h3>

<p>Processing of <code>production.rb</code> has been broken for some time, but poor test coverage meant it went unnoticed. But it is fixed now, so settings in <code>production.rb</code> should override those found in <code>environment.rb</code>. This only applies to Rails 3 applications.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/265">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fix Version Check for Ruby 2.0</h3>

<p>Railroader appears to work fine with Ruby 2.0, but the version check for Ruby 1.9 (which affected some behavior and checks) needed to be modified to include 2.0. Definitely report any issues with Ruby 2.0!</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/277">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Allow HAML 4.0</h3>

<p>There appear to be no changes in HAML 4.0 that affect Railroader, so the gem dependency has been expanded to include the 4.x series.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/269">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fix Error Show/Hide in HTML Report</h3>

<p>Now clicking on &#8220;Exceptions&#8221; to show or hide scan errors will keep the errors in view.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/267">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

<p>Also consider joining the <a href="http://railroaderscanner.org/contact/">mailing list</a> or following <a href="https://twitter.com/railroader">@railroader</a> on Twitter.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/Roadmap">Railroader roadmap</a> has one more release (1.9.4) planned before 2.0. The next release will likely only include bug and false positive fixes. Railroader 2.0 will <em>definitely</em> include breaking changes, especially for JSON reports.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This release is almost entirely enhancements to old checks or new checks for recent vulnerabilities. New features in the next release, I promise.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.9.1</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-0269</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-0276</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-0277</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-0333</li>
<li>Check for more send-like methods (<a href="https://github.com/joernchen">joernchen</a>)</li>
<li>Check for more SQL injection locations</li>
<li>Check for more dangerous YAML methods (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/246">#246</a>)</li>
<li>Support MultiJSON 1.2 for Rails 3.0 and 3.1 (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/247">#247</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>CVE-2013-0269 - Vulnerabilities in JSON gems</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/4_YvCpLzL58/discussion">CVE-2013-0269</a> is not strictly a Rails issue, but since it was announced on the Rails security list and was relatively easy to check, Railroader will warn on it.</p>

<p>Versions of the json/json_pure gem on the 1.7.x branch will raise remote code execution warnings, while any other affected version will be reported as a denial of service vulnerability.</p>

<p>Applications which do not parse user input are not affected by these issues, but it is a good idea to upgrade anyway, as it should be relatively painless.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/262">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>CVE-2013-0276 - attr_protected Bypass</h3>

<p>Railroader has been warning on uses of <code>attr_protected</code> since version 1.4.0, but it was reported with weak confidence, since it is really a best-practice issue.</p>

<p>Now, however, uses of <code>attr_protected</code> will be reported as medium confidence unless used in a Rails version affected by <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/AFBKNY7VSH8/discussion">CVE-2013-0276</a>, in which case it will be high confidence.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/262">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>CVE-2013-0277 - Serialized Attributes</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/KtmwSbEpzrU/discussion">CVE-2013-0277</a> allows attackers to insert malicious YAML into serialized model attributes. Using <code>attr_accessible</code> or <code>attr_protected</code> somewhat mitigates this, but it is still possible for an application to manually assign user input to a serialized attribute.</p>

<p>Railroader will warn on affected models, with confidence level depending on whether or not the attribute can be mass assigned.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/262">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>CVE-2013-0333 - JSON Parsing Vulnerability</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/1h2DR63ViGo/discussion">CVE-2013-0333</a> is another side effect of the recent YAML vulnerabilities. Rails&#8217; default JSON request parser converted requests to YAML then parsed them as YAML.</p>

<p>Railroader will warn on affected versions unless the provided workaround (setting the JSON backend to <code>JSONGem</code>) is present.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/254">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Check for More Send-like Methods</h3>

<p>Thanks to joernchen, Railroader will now warn if user input is passed to <code>try</code>, <code>public_send</code>, or <code>__send__</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/256">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Check for More SQL Injection Sites</h3>

<p>While researching for <a href="http://rails-sqli.org/">rails-sqli.org</a>, a few more methods came up for Railroader to check.</p>

<p>Railroader will now warn on SQL injection in <code>update_all</code> and <code>pluck</code> methods.</p>

<h3>Check for More Dangerous YAML Methods</h3>

<p>Railroader will now warn on dangerous uses of <code>load_documents</code>, <code>load_stream</code>, <code>parse_documents</code>, and <code>parse_stream</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/249">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Support MultiJSON 1.2</h3>

<p>The MultiJSON gem changed some APIs around version 1.3. For convenience, Railroader supported 1.3 or higher. However, for the same reason, Rails 3.0 and 3.1 are locked at versions before 1.3.</p>

<p>For those using Rails 3.0 or 3.1 and including Railroader in the Gemfile, Railroader now supports both the old and new interfaces for MultiJSON and the depedency has been pushed back to MultiJSON 1.2.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/248">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This released was forced due to messed up dependencies with Railroader 1.9.0 and Ruby2Ruby - my fault entirely! As such, this release does not match the roadmap for 1.9.1, which will be changed to 1.9.2.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.9.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add check for CVE-2012-5664 - SQL Injection</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-0155 - SQL Injection</li>
<li>Add check for CVE-2013-0156 - Remote Code Execution</li>
<li>Add check for unsafe <code>YAML.load</code></li>
<li>Update to RubyParser 3.1.1 (neersighted)</li>
<li>Remove ActiveSupport dependency (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Do not warn on arrays passed to <code>link_to</code> (Neil Matatall) (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/232">#232</a>)</li>
<li>Warn on secret tokens (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/200">#200</a>)</li>
<li>Warn on more mass assignment methods (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/223">#223</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>CVE-2012-5664 - SQL Injection</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/DCNTNp_qjFM/discussion">CVE-2012-5664</a> is a vulnerability Rails&#8217; dynamic finders. While dynamic finders (such as <code>User.find_by_name</code>) appear to take a single argument, they also accept a hash options which can be used to modify the SQL query. Normally the hash of options would be the second argument, but it can also be the first. If an application passes in user code as the first argument, it will be interpreted as the options hash, leading to SQL injection.</p>

<p>The provided fix is to only accept the hash if the dynamic finder is called with the proper number of arguments. A workaround is to always cast input to dynamic finders.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/228">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>CVE-2013-0155 - SQL Injection</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/c7jT-EeN9eI/discussion">CVE-2013-0155</a> is a SQL vulnerability where certain JSON input can cause <code>find</code> methods to add <code>NULL</code> as a valid value.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/239">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>CVE-2013-0156 - Remote Code Execution</h3>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion">CVE-2013-0156</a> is the worst Rails vulnerability in recent memory. It allows attackers to easily execute arbitrary code on any Rails application.</p>

<p>Besides upgrading Rails, there are workarounds for this issue: disable XML request parsing or disable YAML/symbol types inside XML requests.</p>

<p>Exploits for this vulnerability are easily available and already in use in the wild. Please upgrade, patch, or use a workaround.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/239">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Check for <code>YAML.load</code></h3>

<p>In light of <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion">CVE-2013-0156</a>, Railroader will now warn on any uses of <code>YAML.load</code> with user input. Do not load arbitrary YAML in applications!</p>

<h3>Dependency Changes</h3>

<p>Railroader now uses the latest RubyParser and Ruby2Ruby versions.</p>

<p>Thanks to Neil, Railroader no longer depends on any version of ActiveSupport or i18n.</p>

<h3>Namespaced URLs in <code>link_to</code></h3>

<p>Railroader will no longer warn on array arguments to <code>link_to</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/233">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Secret Tokens</h3>

<p>Secret tokens stored in source control are bad! Doubly bad if the source code is available publicly. Anyone with access to an application&#8217;s secret token can generate any session cookies they would like. See <a href="http://phenoelit.org/blog/archives/2012/12/21/let_me_github_that_for_you/index.html">this post</a> for details.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/227">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>More Mass Assignment</h3>

<p>Bryan Helmkamp pointed out more Rails methods which perform mass assignment. The following methods have been added: <code>first_or_create</code>, <code>first_or_create!</code>, <code>first_or_initialize!</code>, <code>assign_attributes</code>, and <code>update</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/234">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Happy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggnog_Riot">Eggnog Riot</a> day!</p>

<p>This is a major release: 95 changed files with 1,775 additions and 14,484 deletions. This provides ample room for new bugs, so please report any issues.</p>

<li>Handle empty model files</li>
</ul>


<h3>Update to RubyParser 3</h3>

<p>With the update to use RubyParser 3.x, Railroader no longer includes a vendored version of RubyParser (which was only used with running with Ruby 1.9), which reduced code size by about 14,000 lines.</p>

<p>RubyParser 3 supports Ruby 1.9 much more fully, so there should be very few parse errors. Additionally, Railroader no longer chooses parsers based on the current Ruby version.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/190">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Route Information Ignored by Default</h3>

<p>Route information is only used in Railroader to determine whether a controller method should perform an implicit render. Since determining Rails routes statically is quite difficult to get right, it is better to assume a method is a routable action. Previous versions provided the <code>-a</code> option for this, which is now on by default. To turn off this behavior (and revert to the old), use <code>--no-assume-routes</code>.</p>

<p>This does not affect default route warnings.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/219">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Optional Interprocedural Analysis for Controllers</h3>

<p>Currently, Railroader essentially looks at each method in isolation. Values are propagated from controller actions (including before_filters) through rendered views and templates. But if a controller action calls another method which has an effect on the eventual output of the action, Railroader does not processed the invoked method.</p>

<p>This release includes optional, experimental support for analyzing controller methods called from within controller actions.</p>

<p>For a simple example, instance variables set in helper methods will now be added to a rendered view. Also, values returned from called methods will be tracked:</p>

<pre><code>def create
  get_user 
  #@user is now User.find(params[:id])

  @account = find_account(@user)  
  #@account is now Account.where(:user =&gt; User.find(params[:id]).id
end

private

def get_user
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
end

def find_account
  Account.where(:user =&gt; @user.id)
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is limited to methods available in the controller (via a parent class or mixins). It is also limited to a &#8220;depth of one&#8221;, meaning it will not try to analyze methods called by helper methods (<code>get_user</code> and <code>find_account</code> above).</p>

<p>Since this feature is still experimental and will definitely increase scan times, it is turned off by default. Use <code>--interprocedural</code> to enable it. (Better name pending suggestions&#8230;)</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/218">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Pass Instance Variables between Filters</h3>

<p>While instance variables set in <code>before_filters</code> were set properly, <code>before_filter</code> which used instance variables from an earlier filter could not see those variables. This has been fixed, which will likely lead to new or more accurate warnings.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/224">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Support for <code>strong_parameters</code></h3>

<p>In Rails 4, the responsibility for mass assignment protection will move from models to controllers where mass assignment is actually used. A preview of the new functionality is available in the <a href="https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters">strong_parameters</a> gem. Railroader should no longer warn on mass assignment for models protected with <code>strong_parameters</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/204">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Support <code>validates :format</code></h3>

<p>In Rails 3, format validation changed from <code>validates_format_of</code> to the more generic <code>validates</code> method. Railroader will now check <code>validates</code> calls for proper anchors on regular expressions for <code>:format</code>.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/205">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Changes</h3>

<p>Reports will now contain Railroader version and scan duration. JSON reports contain <code>start_time</code> and <code>end_time</code> timestamps. For now, JSON reports will still have a <code>timestamp</code> key, but it will be identical to <code>end_time</code>. It will be removed in Railroader 2.0.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/193">changes</a>)</p>

<p>Additionally, code formatting in JSON reports has changed slightly. Previously, code was formatted with the HTML output in mind, so line breaks were removed. Now JSON reports include the code formatted from Ruby2Ruby without any mangling.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/191">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fix Command Injection Check</h3>

<p>The command injection check will now (again) warn on any form on string interpolation used for process execution, whether or not user input is involved.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/216">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fix <code>to_sql</code> False Positives</h3>

<p>SQL code generated from Arel&#8217;s <code>to_sql</code> method will be considered safe.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/194">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>File System Facade</h3>

<p>Bryan Helmkamp cleaned up Railroader&#8217;s file access into a single object. This should simplify future changes and add some consistency to how Railroader handles files.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/197">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Run Tests via Rake</h3>

<p>Thanks to Michael Grosser, running <code>rake</code> will now run Railroader&#8217;s tests.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/183">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Improved Config File Locations</h3>

<p>Also thanks to Michael Grosser, Railroader will check more sane locations for Railroader configuration files. This version adds <code>./config/railroader.yml</code>, <code>~/.railroader/config.yml</code>, and <code>/etc/railroader/config.yml</code> as default locations for configuration files. The old locations are deprecated now, and will be removed in Railroader 2.0.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/182">changes</a></p>

<h3>More Internal Changes</h3>

<p>Call indexing performance has been given another <a href="http://blog.presidentbeef.com/">slight boost</a> with the removal of the ability to search for call targets via regular expressions (which was not being used anywhere).</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/189">changes</a>)</p>

<p>The number of s-expressions generated by Railroader has been reduced, although this did not lead to any major performance improvement.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/207">changes</a>)</p>

<p>Data-flow/alias processing was performing two passes. This has been reduced to just one.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/224">changes</a>)</p>

<p>Empty model files will no longer cause errors.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is primarily a false positive reduction release. One major change is the change in dependency from the <code>json_pure</code> gem to <code>multi_json</code>.</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.8.2</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>multi_json</code> gem for better harmony (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/164">#164</a>)</li>
<li>Performance improvement for call indexing</li>
<li>Fix issue with processing HAML files (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/168">#168</a>)</li>
<li>Handle pre-release versions when processing <code>Gemfile.lock</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/174">#174</a>)</li>
<li>Only check first argument of <code>redirect_to</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/98">#98</a>)</li>
<li>Fix false positives from <code>Model.arel_table</code> accesses</li>
<li>Fix false positives on redirects to models decorated with Draper gem (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/172">#172</a>)</li>
<li>Fix false positive on redirect to model association (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/111">#111</a>)</li>
<li>Fix false positive on <code>YAML.load</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/142">#142</a>)</li>
<li>Fix false positive XSS on any <code>to_i</code> output</li>
<li>Fix error on Rails 2 named routes with no args</li>
<li>Fix error in rescan of mixins with symbols in method name</li>
<li>Do not rescan non-Ruby files in config/</li>
</ul>


<h3>Change to MultiJSON</h3>

<p>Railroader now depends on the <a href="http://rdoc.info/github/intridea/multi_json">multijson</a> gem instead of <code>json_pure</code>. This should make it easier for people who include Railroader as a dependency.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/166">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Faster Call Indexing</h3>

<p>Dumb code in the <code>CallIndex</code> was causing call indexing to be slow on some large applications. This should now be faster and require less memory!</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/180">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Fix HAML Processing</h3>

<p>Some HAML files were causing Railroader&#8217;s alias processing to slow to a crawl. This was due to the template code (sometimes) directly appending to the output variable via <code>&lt;&lt;</code>. Since Railroader attempts to treat targets of <code>&lt;&lt;</code> as arrays, Railroader was generating large data structures each time <code>&lt;&lt;</code> was encountered.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/170">changes</a>]</p>

<h3>Handle Pre-release Versions</h3>

<p>When a <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file is present in a Rails application, Railroader uses it to determine the version of Rails in use. Previous versions did not accept pre-release version numbers (like <code>3.1.2.rc1</code>), leading to version inappropriate warnings.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/176">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Redirect False Positives</h3>

<p>Several false positives related to redirects have been fixed, and the scope of the redirect check is somewhat reduced.</p>

<p>Calls beginning with <code>Model.arel_table</code> should no longer be treated as user input (in any context).</p>

<p>Model instances returned by the <code>decorate</code> method in the <a href="https://github.com/drapergem/draper">Draper</a> gem are considered safe.</p>

<p>Redirects to model associations (e.g, <code>belongs_to :account</code>) are considered safe.</p>

<p>Redirects to method calls with safe values should no longer warn. For example:</p>

<pre><code>redirect_to blah(User.first) #No warning
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, only the first argument of <code>redirect_to</code> will be checked for user input.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/177">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>YAML False Positive</h3>

<p>File access warnings for YAML calls have been reduced to only those calls which actually access files.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/178">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Integer Output False Positives</h3>

<p>Calls to <code>to_i</code> should not trigger XSS warnings.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/179">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Errors on Named Routes</h3>

<p>Rails 2 named routes with no arguments were causing errors, which have now been fixed.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/181">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>

<p>Now that RubyParser 3.x is officially released, work is underway to use the new version. This will increase Ruby 1.9 syntax compatibility and remove the need to parse applications with the same Ruby version as the application uses. Additionally, it will allow us to get rid of the vendored version of RubyParser that Railroader uses for Ruby 1.9. Unfortunately, RubyParser 3.x introduces a lot of incompatibilities and upgrading requires a significant amount of effort.</p>

<p>Another exciting feature in development is limited interprocedural analysis. Railroader will be able to handle simple things like calls to helper methods in controllers which set instance variables or return user input. This should help with the &#8220;obvious&#8221; vulnerabilities that Railroader often misses.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a bugfix release, in particular fixing rescanning (used by <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-railroader">guard-railroader</a>).</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.8.1</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed rescanning problems caused by 1.8.0 changes</li>
<li>Fix scope calls with single argument</li>
<li>Report specific model name in rendered collections</li>
<li>Handle overwritten JSON escape settings (Neil Matatall)</li>
<li>Add CHANGES to gemspec</li>
</ul>


<h3>Rescan Fixes</h3>

<p>Railroader supports rescanning a subset of files in an application, with the caveat that the previous scan must still be in memory. This functionality was broken in the the 1.8.0 release, due to the lack of tests.</p>

<p>This release updates rescanning to be more robust and work with the 1.8.0 changes to how &#8220;render paths&#8221; are stored. Also, a number of tests were added to help prevent breakage in the future.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/165">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Scope Calls with One Argument</h3>

<p>Calls to <code>scope</code> with a single argument were causing errors in Railroader&#8217;s SQL injection check.</p>

<p>The fixed error looked like:</p>

<pre><code>undefined method `node_type' for nil:NilClass  /something/railroader/lib/railroader/checks/check_sql.rb:75:in `block (2 levels) in find_scope_calls'
</code></pre>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/157">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Model Names for Rendered Collections</h3>

<p>In cases like below, where a collection of models is being rendered and the model name could be known, any resulting warnings will now reference the actual model name.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render 'user', :collection =&gt; User.all %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Previously, Railroader would report warnings with <code>UnknownModel</code>, whether or not the model name was actually known.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/155">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Overwritten JSON Escape Config</h3>

<p>It is possible that a config setting in one initializer overrides a setting in a different initializer. This is now handled for the JSON escape settings.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/154">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>CHANGES File in Gem</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/blob/master/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file is now included in the gem file as requested.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/153">changes</a>)</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/wiki/How-to-Report-a-Railroader-Issue">this guide</a> to reporting Railroader problems.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bug fixes!</p>

<p><em>Changes since 1.8.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recover from errors in output formatting (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/148">#148</a>)</li>
<li>Fix false positive in <code>redirect_to</code> (Neil Matatall) (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/143">#143</a>)</li>
<li>Fix problems with removal of <code>Sexp#method_missing</code> (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/150">#150</a>)</li>
<li>Fix array indexing in alias processing (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/145">#145</a>)</li>
<li>Fix old <code>mail_to</code> vulnerability check (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/147">#147</a>)</li>
<li>Fix rescans when only controller action changes (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/141">#141</a>)</li>
<li>Allow comparison of versions with unequal lengths (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/144">#144</a>)</li>
<li>Handle super calls with blocks (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/146">#146</a>)</li>
<li>Remove malformed Sexps from HAML processing  (<a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/pull/149">#149</a>)</li>
<li>Respect <code>-q</code> flag for &#8220;Rails 3 detected&#8221; message</li>
</ul>


<h3>Fix Crashes when Generating Report</h3>

<p>Some scans were causing Railroader to crash while generating reports with an error like:</p>

<pre><code>lib/railroader/warning.rb:78:in `format_code': undefined method `gsub' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
</code></pre>

<p>This was due to a combination of the removal of <code>method_missing</code> behavior from <code>Sexp</code> and the <code>OutputProcessor</code> not handling errors well.</p>

<p>The problem should be fixed now, but please report an issue if &#8220;[Format Error]&#8221; shows up in reports.</p>

<h3>False Positive in Redirect Check</h3>

<p>Neil Matatall fixed <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues/143">an issue</a> with a false positive when redirecting to an array.</p>

<p>When <code>redirect_to</code> is given an array, Rails eventually falls through to <code>polymorphic_path</code>, which will only return a path, not a full URL. Railroader only checks for redirects that can redirect to a different host, so this is considered safe.</p>

<h3>Sexp and <code>method_missing</code></h3>

<p>The original <code>Sexp</code> code from RubyParser uses <code>method_missing</code> to find and optionally delete nodes. This functionality is not used very often (never in Railroader) but has covered up bugs that would otherwise been found. Therefore, <code>Sexp#method_missing</code> has been removed in Railroader. However, it turns out that <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby2ruby">Ruby2Ruby</a> uses it in a couple places. Railroader uses Ruby2Ruby to covert s-expressions back to readable Ruby code, particularly when generating reports. This lead to some crashes.</p>

<h3>Fix Array Indexing</h3>

<p>Railroader can handle pulling values out of simple arrays. Or it should be able to, but it keeps breaking. Should be fixed now!</p>

<h3>Fix <code>mail_to</code> Check</h3>

<p>There is a Railroader check for an <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/8CpI7egxX4E/discussion">old vulnerability</a> in <code>mail_to</code>. However, it turns out this check has been broken for a while. But now it is fixed! And there are regression tests.</p>

<h3>Fix Rescans on Controller Changes</h3>

<p>There were some crashes when rescanning was triggered by a controller change.</p>

<h3>HAML Processing</h3>

<p>Some very old code for HAML processing was generating malformed s-expressions, which then had to be handled specially in the output formatter. It turns out these nodes were not even used, so they were removed. Please report any problems arising from this! We do not have a lot of HAML test cases.</p>

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>Please report any <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/railroader/issues">issues</a> with this release!</p>
